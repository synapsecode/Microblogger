      "boys in those Southern parts grow apace and in a little while he was madly in love with a pretty girl who lived on the Grande Marina.  She had eyes like forest pools and held herself like a daughter of the Caesars.  They were affianced, but they could not marry till Salvatore had done his military service, and when he left the island which he had never left in his life before, to become a sailor in the navy of King Victor Emmanuel, he wept like a child.  It was hard for one who had never been less free than the birds to be at the beck and call of others, it was harder still to live in a battleship with strangers instead of in a little white cottage among the vines; and when he was ashore, to walk in noisy, friendless cities with streets so crowded that he was frightened to cross them, when he had been used to silent paths and the mountains and the sea.  I suppose it had never struck him that Ischia, which he looked at every evening (it was like a fairy island in the sunset) to see what the weather would be like next day, or Vesuvius, pearly in the dawn, had anything to do with him at all; but when he ceased to have them before his eyes he realized in some dim fashion that they were as much part of him as his hands and his feet.  He was dreadfully homesick.  But it was hardest of all to be parted from the girl he loved with all his passionate young heart.  He wrote to her (in his childlike handwriting) long, ill-spelt letters in which he told her how constantly he thought of her and how much he longed to be back.  He was sent here and there, to Spezzia, to Venice, to Ban and finally to China.  Here he fell ill of some mysterious ailment that kept him in hospital for months.  He bore it with the mute and uncomprehending patience of a dog.  When he learnt that it was a form of rheumatism that made him unfit for further service his heart exulted, for he could go home; and he did not bother, in fact he scarcely listened, when the doctors told him that he would never again be quite well. What did he care when he was going back to the little island he loved so well and the girl who was waiting I for him? When he got into the rowing-boat that met the steamer from Naples and was rowed ashore he saw his father and mother standing on the jetty and his two brothers, big boys now, and he waved to them.  His eyes searched t among the crowd that waited there, for the girl. ";

      "Jayanto, the protagonist, works in the editorial section of a newspaper and Shankar, the narrator is a school teacher. Both of them are great friends and have finally managed to get some time to go on a trip together. They decide to go to Bundi; a village in Rajasthan where Jayanto had been before in his childhood with his parents. They stay at the Circuit house (a kind of guest house) where Jayanto had stayed before in his childhood due to his father’s frequent work trips there. Upon reaching, Shankar realises that Jayanto is in somewhat pensive mood and queries about it. Jayanto says that the old memories are rushing into his mind. Shankar thinks that being the overemotional guy Jayanto is, he’s being nostalgic, so he doesn’t say anything in that matter. They go for sightseeing in the compound and suddenly Jayanto remembers that there was a tall deodar tree there. He searches for it and finds it at the end of the compound. He looks at the trunk searchingly and says here he had met a European but doesn’t exactly remember who it was or how they had met. They return to the Circuit house where Dilwar, the cook, has prepared their dinner. Meanwhile Jayanto seems to remember the old memory of the European. He tells Shankar the tale about Fritz which Shankar hears amusedly. It was a one-foot tall Swiss doll brought from Switzerland by his uncle for him. He says he was very much attached to the doll and was devastated when two stray dogs had mutilated it. He had buried the doll’s remnants under the very same deodar tree. Shankar is quite tired so he goes to bed but wakes up abruptly in the middle of the night and finds Jayanto sitting on his bed, looking perplexed. Upon asking the reason, Jayanto says that something had walked over his chest when he was asleep. Shankar assures that it could have been his dream but Jayanto shows him his pillow. Faint marks were there pointing to the fact that an animal had walked over it. Shankar does a thorough search of the place but doesn’t find any small animal like mice or rats. Shankar feels that his friend is just exaggerating but tells him soothing words nevertheless. After this they both go to sleep.The following day, during their visit to an old fort on the hills, Jayanto remains quite lost in thoughts. After returning, Shankar queries about it persistently. Jayanto says that Fritz, the doll, had come back alive and it was the doll last night who had walked over his chest leaving his footprints. Shankar, now annoyed with Jayanto’s irrational fears, suggests to dig up the doll’s grave and see for himself that the doll isn’t back. Jayanto agrees; together they have the gardener dig the place where Fritz had been buried. To their horror, they find a pure white 12-inch skeleton, exactly the same size as Fritz. They both are confused and scared to see this. Naturally, weird thoughts and assumptions pop into their mind. The story ends here on a cliffhanger.";
  String johnbrownStory =
      "ohn brown is an anti-war song composed and performed by the American singer-songwriter and Nobel laureate Bob Dylan. The song is an expression of the singer’s deep-rooted sense of pacifism. Bob Dylan is known for upholding American folk music and his work is seen to be highly influenced by the poets of Modernism and Beatnik movements. His songs are generally easy to follow with a deep philosophical meaning. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016 for his outstanding contribution in creating new poetic expressions in the American song tradition. John Brown is, as previously mentioned, an anti-war lyric. It tells the story of an American mother who sends her son John Brown to war on some foreign land. The song follows the young soldier and his mother’s lives. The singer shows us the true fate of the American soldiers who are stationed in foreign countries for war. He also questions the very nature of war and shows us that there is no nobility in warfare, thereby strengthening the idea of pacifism.";

He tried to delve deeper into its history and found that the statue was bought by Sir Alexander Heathcote, a diplomatic person of great acclaim. He also happened to be a very fastidious person. He would have breakfast at the same time every morning, with the same ingredients in the exact same quantity, reach his office desk at the Foreign Office at exactly 8:59 AM and leave for home at exactly 6 in the evening.";
